# GoRGO

#### A Parsing Toolbox

There is no shortage of parser generator, ranging from good old *bison* to *ANTLR* and various Go variants like *gocc*.
Why develop another one? GoRGO is a little different.

## Status
This is very much work in progress. Not yet intended for production use. Please be patient.
