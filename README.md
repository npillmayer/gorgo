# GoRGO

#### A Parsing Toolbox

There is no shortage of parser generator, ranging from good old *bison* to *ANTLR* and various Go variants like *gocc*.
Why develop another one?

All these tools have their value and I appreciate the availability of compiler-compilers with a lot of horse power. But on the other hand, sometimes I want something more compact, a smart and lightweight tool to generate an interpreter for a custom language. And I want it in native Go, as this is what I currently use for Open Source. Thatâ€™s what GoRGO strives to be.

GoRGO is a little different.

## Status
This is very much work in progress. Not yet intended for production use. Please be patient.
