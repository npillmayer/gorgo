Earley-Parsing
==============

A great introduction to Earley-parsing may be found at
[Loup  Vaillant's Blog](http://loup-vaillant.fr/tutorials/earley-parsing).
Here is what he has to say:

> The biggest advantage of Earley Parsing is its accessibility. Most other tools such as parser generators,

If speed (or the lack thereof) is critical to your project, you should probably grab ANTLR or
Bison. I used both a lot in my programming life. However, there are many scenarios where I wished
I had a more lightweight alternative at hand. Oftentimes I found myself writing recursive-descent
parsers for small ad-hoc languages by hand, sometimes mixing them with the lexer-part of one of
the big players.
